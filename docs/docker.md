# Running all the components with docker compose

There are following docker compose files provided to run origin stack based on the latest **canary** versions of NPM packages:

-   Vanilla Origin version with a **custom Device Registry** (`origin.local.yml`)
-   **I-REC compliant** Origin version (`origin.local.irec.yml`)

All compose files require docker images to be built locally.

## Building docker images locally

    Make sure you completed <a href="../getting-started">Getting started</a> in order to install and build Origin monorepo.

</div>

-   Check out the latest code from the [Origin repository](https://github.com/energywebfoundation/origin)
-   Execute the following commands from the code folder to build the codebase:

```shell
rush update
rush build #in case of errors it is necessary to execute rush rebuild
```

-   Build docker images

    ```shell
    yarn build:containers:canary
    ```

## Start chosen stack

To start chosen stack, for example **I-REC compliant** Origin, execute the following:

```shell
docker-compose -f origin.local.yml up -d
```

`-d` option detaches your terminal from docker compose logs, to see them, execute:

```shell
docker-compose -f origin.local.yml logs -f
```

## Stopping the stack

to stop the stack without loosing data, execute

```shell
docker-compose -f origin.local.yml down
```

by adding `-v` option you will also delete all volumes linked to this stack and loose all data

## Possible collisions

If you experiment and run multiple stacks, you can use `-p <stack name>` option to name your stacks. Docker compose
prefixes service names with it. Otherwise folder name is used as a name of a stack.
