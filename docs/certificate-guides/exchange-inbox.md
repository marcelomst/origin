[**UI Components**](https://github.com/energywebfoundation/origin/tree/master/packages/ui/libs/certificate/view/src/pages/ExchangeInboxPage)

The Exchange Inbox shows all of your organization's certificates that are currently on the Exchange.

**When the issuing body approves a certificate request, the certificate is immediatley deposited into the Exchange Inbox (unless the user has selected the ["Full Self-Ownership" toggle](../user-guide-reg-onboarding.md#full-self-Ownership) in the User Profile settings, in which case the certificate is deposited into the [Blockchain Inbox](./blockchain-inbox.md)).**  

Certificates must be in the Exchange Inbox in order to be:  

1. Posted for sale
2. Transferred to another exchange deposit address
3. Transferred to the [Blockchain Inbox](./blockchain-inbox.md)
4. Exported to an I-REC account. 

If you want to move certificate hours from this inbox into your organization’s [Blockchain Inbox](./blockchain-inbox.md), you must use the [Withdraw](#withdraw) tab on this interface.
