# Import Certificate
[**UI Components**](https://github.com/energywebfoundation/origin/tree/master/packages/ui/libs/certificate/view/src/pages/CertificatesImportPage)

This interface allows users to import certificates from the I-REC registry that are not yet on the Origin platform. You must be connected to the I-REC API in order to view the certificates eligible for import. Read how to connect to I-REC [here](../organization-guides/connect-irec.md).
