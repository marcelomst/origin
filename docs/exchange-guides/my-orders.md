# My Orders
[**UI Components**](https://github.com/energywebfoundation/origin/tree/master/packages/ui/libs/exchange/view/src/pages/MyOrdersPage)

The ‘My Orders’ interface allows a user to see all of the [bids](../user-guide-glossary.md#bid), [asks](../user-guide-glossary.md#ask) and [demands](../user-guide-glossary.md#demand) that users from their organization have created using the [Market interface](./view-market.md#market).

## Demands
[Demands](../user-guide-glossary.md#demand) are recurring bids. They are created on the [View Market](./view-market.md) interface by creating a ['Repeated Purchase'](./view-market.md#repeated-purchase).

### Update Demand
